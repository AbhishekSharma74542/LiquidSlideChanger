The highly flammable silk and cotton materials used for the skirts and the wide base between the legs of the wearer also meant the flame could burn easily. In fact, the New York Times reported that—within two months—19 women were killed after their crinolines caught fire. Aside from being caught in a fire, women wearing crinolines were sometimes blown around by heavy winds.
